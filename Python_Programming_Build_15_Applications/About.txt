Description:
Learn the programming fundamentals with Python 3 ! Python for beginners 
Complete Python Bootcamp! Rise from a beginner to an advanced level 
programmer in no time ‚åö! This specialized course is truly meant to make 
you an advanced level programmer !

Whether you become a Python developer,  Full Stack Web Developer or 
Data Scientist - this course will help you in every way and we will 
do the same by not just learning but mastering the skills as well! 
And to the same we will create 15+ applications with python like:

- Dice Roller : Python GUI application with tkinter to generate random 
dice outputs

- Total Seconds & Days Counter : Another GUI Python application which will 
calculate how much days and seconds one has lived

- Length Converter : Interchange length units like Foot, Meters & Inch 
with Python programming through a Python GUI application

- Image to Icon Converter : Convert .png, .jpg, .jpeg, etc. images into 
icons with python gui programming

- Random element selector : Pass a certain number of choices like blue 
dress or red dress and get a decision picked

- Data Analysis : Analyze data with numpy and pandas library

- Data Visualization : Plot different visuals of data like bar charts, 
pie charts, graphs, area plots, etc. with matplotlib

- Trees Survey Report : Generate a survey report with data science

- User Credentials Data : Manage the credentials of users like first name, 
last name, email, etc.
