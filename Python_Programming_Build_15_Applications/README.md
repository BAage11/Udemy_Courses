Many of the programs can be run using any IDE of your liking, for example Visual Studio Code.<br>
Exceptions:

   - Files with the notation '.ipynb' are Anaconda based, and can be run with the glossary <br>found under 'Anaconda Documentation.txt' under the folder named 'Advanced'.

   - GUI applications are programmed using PyCharm, and shall be run within that specific IDE preferably.
